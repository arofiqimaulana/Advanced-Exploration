# SQL for Data Analysis

## Introduction
Structured Query Language (SQL) is a powerful tool for managing and analyzing data stored in relational databases. SQL is widely used for data analysis because it provides a simple yet flexible way to query, manipulate, and summarize data. Whether you're working with small datasets or large-scale enterprise data, SQL is a must-have skill for any data analyst.

## Key SQL Concepts
- **Tables**: Data is stored in tables, which consist of rows and columns.
- **Columns**: Define the attributes or fields of the data.
- **Rows**: Each row represents a record in the table.
- **Primary Key**: A unique identifier for a row in a table.
- **Foreign Key**: A column that creates a relationship between two tables.

## Installation

To start using SQL for data analysis, you need access to a relational database management system (RDBMS). Here are some popular options:

1. **SQLite** (lightweight, file-based database):
   - Install SQLite from the official website: https://www.sqlite.org/download.html

2. **PostgreSQL** (open-source, enterprise-level database):
   - Install PostgreSQL: https://www.postgresql.org/download/

3. **MySQL** (widely used in web applications):
   - Install MySQL: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/

You can also use cloud-based databases like **Google BigQuery**, **Amazon Redshift**, or **Microsoft Azure SQL Database**.

## Basic SQL Queries

### Selecting Data
The `SELECT` statement is used to retrieve data from a table.

```sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name;
```

Example:
```sql
SELECT name, age
FROM customers;
```

### Filtering Data
The `WHERE` clause filters records based on a condition.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE age > 30;
```

### Sorting Data
The `ORDER BY` clause sorts data in ascending (`ASC`) or descending (`DESC`) order.

```sql
SELECT name, age
FROM customers
ORDER BY age DESC;
```

### Grouping and Aggregating Data
`GROUP BY` is used to group rows with the same values, and aggregate functions like `SUM()`, `COUNT()`, `AVG()` can be used on the grouped data.

```sql
SELECT department, COUNT(*)
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;
```

---

## Joins

### Inner Join
The `INNER JOIN` keyword selects records that have matching values in both tables.

```sql
SELECT employees.name, departments.department_name
FROM employees
INNER JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;
```

### Left Join
The `LEFT JOIN` returns all records from the left table and the matched records from the right table.

```sql
SELECT employees.name, departments.department_name
FROM employees
LEFT JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;
```

### Right Join
The `RIGHT JOIN` returns all records from the right table and the matched records from the left table.

```sql
SELECT employees.name, departments.department_name
FROM employees
RIGHT JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;
```

### Full Outer Join
The `FULL OUTER JOIN` returns all records when there is a match in either the left or right table.

```sql
SELECT employees.name, departments.department_name
FROM employees
FULL OUTER JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;
```

---

## Window Functions
Window functions perform calculations across a set of table rows that are related to the current row. Common examples are `ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`, and `LAG()`.

```sql
SELECT name, department, salary,
       RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rank
FROM employees;
```

---

## Advanced SQL

### Subqueries
A subquery is a query nested inside another query. It can be used in the `SELECT`, `FROM`, or `WHERE` clauses.

```sql
SELECT name
FROM employees
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);
```

### Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
A CTE is a temporary result set that you can reference within a `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` statement.

```sql
WITH avg_salary AS (
    SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS avg_sal
    FROM employees
    GROUP BY department
)
SELECT e.name, e.salary, avg_salary.avg_sal
FROM employees e
JOIN avg_salary ON e.department = avg_salary.department;
```
